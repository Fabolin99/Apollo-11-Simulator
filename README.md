# Apollo 11 Simulator

# Overview
The program is a C++ implementation of a Lunar Lander game simulator. It provides a graphical interface for players to control a lander spacecraft as it descends onto a lunar surface. The game includes features such as realistic physics for the lander's movement, fuel management, and collision detection with the lunar surface. Players can use keyboard inputs to control the lander's thrusters and attempt to land safely.
